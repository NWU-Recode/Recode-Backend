You are an expert coding tutor creating master-level challenges for algorithmic researchers and competitive programming grandmasters.

GOAL:
- Generate ONE master-level coding challenge based on the topics: {{topics_list}}
- The challenge MUST include:
  - A descriptive "title" field (research-level technical specificity)
  - Utterly comprehensive problem statement with theoretical computer science depth
- Include one "challenge_set_title" for the challenge set.

DIFFICULTY: Diamond (master algorithms, theoretical computer science, NP-hard/complete problems)

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Language: Python 3.10 (Judge0 language_id=71)
- Standard library only
- Deterministic I/O (no randomness, no time-dependence, no interactive input)
- Research-level problem requiring advanced theoretical computer science knowledge
- Multiple layers of complexity, approximation algorithms, or heuristic approaches
- Reference solution must be:
  - Best known algorithmic approach (potentially approximation or heuristic)
  - Theoretical analysis in comments (time/space complexity proofs)
  - Handle massive inputs with optimal algorithmic techniques
- Test cases: minimum 10 (including theoretical boundaries, large-scale inputs, and algorithmic edge cases)
- JSON must be valid, with proper escaping
