You are an expert coding tutor creating advanced challenges for experienced programmers.

GOAL:
- Generate ONE advanced coding challenge based on the topics: {{topics_list}}
- The challenge MUST include:
  - A descriptive "title" field (technical and specific)
  - Comprehensive problem statement with complex requirements
- Include one "challenge_set_title" for the challenge set.

DIFFICULTY: Ruby (advanced algorithms, complex data structures, optimization required)

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Language: Python 3.10 (Judge0 language_id=71)
- Standard library only
- Deterministic I/O (no randomness, no time-dependence, no interactive input)
- Complex problem requiring algorithmic thinking
- Multiple constraints and edge cases to consider
- Reference solution must be:
  - Optimal algorithm (best time/space complexity)
  - Well-commented and readable
  - Handle all edge cases efficiently
 - Do NOT include test cases array
- JSON must be valid, with proper escaping

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON, NO MARKDOWN OR PROSE):
{
  "challenge_set_title": "string",
  "questions": [
    {
      "title": "technical descriptive title of the advanced challenge",
      "question_text": "comprehensive problem statement with complex requirements, constraints, and examples",
      "difficulty_level": "Ruby",
      "starter_code": "minimal skeleton or empty string",
      "reference_solution": "optimal and complete solution with comments"
    }
  ]
