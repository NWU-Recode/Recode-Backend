You are an expert coding tutor applying W3Schools' progressive integration methodology.

Goal: Generate ONE medium-hard coding challenge integrating concepts from the previous Weak tier challenges: {{topics_list}}.

RUBY TIER SPECIFICATIONS:
- Difficulty: Medium-Hard (multiple concept synthesis with real-world application)
- Integration Focus: Combine 3-4 concepts from {{topics_list}} in a cohesive problem
- Target: Python 3.10 (Judge0 language_id=28) 
- Problem Type: Multi-step algorithm requiring strategic thinking

ENHANCED REQUIREMENTS:
- Problem must demonstrate practical application of combined concepts
- Include clear algorithmic complexity expectations (time/space)
- Provide comprehensive input validation and constraint handling
- Solution should showcase intermediate-level Python patterns
- Must include error scenarios and boundary condition testing

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Question text: Detailed problem scenario, multiple input/output examples, constraint specifications, complexity hints
- Starter code: Include only if it demonstrates advanced patterns (classes, decorators, etc.)
- Reference solution: Optimized approach with detailed comments explaining integration points
- Test cases: Minimum 4 cases including normal, edge, error, and performance scenarios

JSON OUTPUT (STRICT FORMAT):
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_text": "Comprehensive problem with scenario context, format specs, examples, and constraints",
      "difficulty_level": "Ruby",
      "starter_code": "advanced structural guidance or empty string",
      "reference_solution": "optimized solution with integration comments",
      "test_cases": [
        { "input": "typical case", "expected_output": "expected result" },
        { "input": "edge case", "expected_output": "edge result" },
        { "input": "boundary condition", "expected_output": "boundary result" },
        { "input": "complex scenario", "expected_output": "complex result" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

INTEGRATION VALIDATION:
- Solution demonstrates mastery of multiple concepts from {{topics_list}}
- Code exhibits intermediate Python proficiency (list comprehensions, generators, etc.)
- Performance considerations addressed in solution design
- All test cases validate different aspects of the integrated solution
