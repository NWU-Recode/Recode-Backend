# Deployment Status & Issues

## âœ… FIXED: Batch Submission Stdout Issue

### Problem

Batch submission responses were returning empty `stdout` fields, causing all code execution tests to fail.

### Root Cause

Judge0's batch GET endpoint returns `{"submissions": [...]}` but our code was checking if the response was a list, so it never parsed the submissions.

### Solution

- Fixed `app/features/judge0/service.py` `get_batch_results()` to extract submissions array
- Changed all `fields` parameters to use `*` instead of specific field lists
- Fixed submissions service to not initialize stdout from None values

### Testing

Direct Judge0 service test confirmed the fix works:

```bash
python test_judge0_batch.py
# Results: All submissions correctly return stdout âœ…
```

## ðŸ”´ BLOCKING ISSUE: Server Instability

### Problem

The FastAPI server crashes or hangs when processing requests, making it impossible to test the batch submission endpoint through the API.

### Symptoms

1. Server starts successfully
2. `/healthz` endpoint works
3. Batch submission requests hang indefinitely
4. `atlastk` library signal handler interferes with uvicorn
5. Server receives SIGINT and crashes during request processing

### Suspected Causes

1. **atlastk dependency** - Listed in requirements.txt but not used in code, its signal handler conflicts with uvicorn
2. **Database connection issues** - Long query times or connection pool exhaustion
3. **Judge0 timeout** - Requests may be waiting too long for Judge0 responses
4. **Async/await issues** - Potential deadlock in concurrent Judge0 execution

### Immediate Actions Needed

#### 1. Remove atlastk Dependency

```bash
pip uninstall atlastk
# Remove from requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Test Endpoint Directly

Once server is stable, test with:

```powershell
$body = @'
{
  "submissions": {
    "388a2b21-bab3-44a0-bd02-907adeebf686": {
      "source_code": "# Read the data\nn = int(input())\nnumbers = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\ntarget = int(input())\n\n# Count occurrences\ncount = numbers.count(target)\nprint(count)",
      "language_id": 71
    }
  }
}
'@

$headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" }

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/submissions/challenges/b40d7802-4c06-460a-befb-373718608ab4/submit-challenge" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers $headers `
  -Body $body `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -TimeoutSec 120
```

#### 3. Add Debug Logging

Temporarily add logging to see where requests hang:

```python
# In app/features/submissions/endpoints.py submit_challenge()
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info(f"Received challenge submission for {challenge_id}")
logger.info(f"Calling submissions_service.submit_challenge...")
breakdown = await submissions_service.submit_challenge(...)
logger.info(f"Service returned, processing results...")
```

#### 4. Check Judge0 Connectivity

```powershell
# Test Judge0 directly
$body = @{ source_code = "print('test')"; language_id = 71 } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://ec2-3-217-31-230.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2358/submissions?base64_encoded=false&wait=true&fields=*" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes (Complete)

- âœ… `app/features/judge0/service.py` - Fixed batch response parsing, changed fields to `*`
- âœ… `app/features/submissions/service.py` - Fixed stdout initialization
- âœ… `test_judge0_batch.py` - Test script confirms fix works

### Documentation

- âœ… `STDOUT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed fix documentation
- âœ… `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix server stability issue
   - Remove atlastk dependency
   - Add request timeout handling
   - Add comprehensive logging

2. **TEST**: Verify batch submission endpoint
   - Test with single submission
   - Test with all 5 questions
   - Verify stdout appears in all responses

3. **DEPLOY**: Once stable
   - Update production environment
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check Judge0 performance

## CORS Configuration

CORS is properly configured in `app/main.py`:

```python
allow_origins=["https://recode-frontend.vercel.app", "http://localhost:*", ...]
allow_credentials=True
allow_methods=["*"]
allow_headers=["*"]
```

The CORS error you're seeing is likely because:

1. Server is not running/responding
2. Frontend is trying to connect before server is ready
3. Network connectivity issue

Once server stability is fixed, CORS should work correctly.

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Remove atlastk from requirements.txt
- [ ] Test local server stability
- [ ] Verify batch submission returns stdout
- [ ] Test with production frontend
- [ ] Monitor Judge0 performance
- [ ] Set up proper error tracking
- [ ] Add request timeout limits
- [ ] Configure connection pool sizes
- [ ] Test under load

## Support Information

- Judge0 CE Instance: `http://ec2-3-217-31-230.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2358`
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Current Branch: `We_Finish_This`
- Python Version: 3.13
- FastAPI with Uvicorn

## Contact

If server continues to hang:

1. Check database connection pool settings
2. Verify Judge0 instance is responding
3. Review asyncio event loop for deadlocks
4. Consider using Gunicorn with workers instead of Uvicorn
