# üéØ BATCH UPLOAD FIX SUMMARY

## ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Week Number Calculation Fixed**
**Problem**: Week was calculating as 1 for all files instead of 1-12  
**Root Cause**: `week_offset = idx` meant week 0, 0, 0... instead of 1, 2, 3...  
**Solution**: Changed to `week_number = idx + 1` (Week 1 for first file, Week 2 for second, etc.)

**Location**: `app/features/slides/endpoints.py` line ~445  
```python
# OLD:
week_offset = idx  # This was 0, 1, 2... but week needs to be 1, 2, 3...

# NEW:
week_number = idx + 1  # Week 1 for first file, Week 2 for second, etc.
week_offset = idx  # 0 weeks from start for first file
```

### 2. **Special Challenge Generation Added**
**Problem**: Only BASE challenges were generated, no special challenges on even weeks  
**Root Cause**: No logic to generate special challenges for weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12  
**Solution**: Added Phase 3 to batch upload that generates:
- **ALL WEEKS**: Base challenge
- **EVEN WEEKS (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)**: BOTH base + special challenge

**Special Tier Mapping**:
- Weeks 2, 4 ‚Üí **Ruby** challenge
- Weeks 6, 8 ‚Üí **Emerald** challenge  
- Weeks 10, 12 ‚Üí **Diamond** challenge

**Location**: `app/features/slides/endpoints.py` line ~520  
```python
# Phase 3: Generate challenges for each week
for idx, (filename, extraction) in enumerate(extractions):
    week_num = extraction.get("week_number")
    
    # Always generate base challenge
    challenge_tasks.append(generate_and_save_tier(
        tier="base",
        week_number=week_num,
        ...
    ))
    
    # For even weeks, also generate special challenge
    if week_num % 2 == 0:
        if week_num == 2 or week_num == 4:
            special_tier = "ruby"
        elif week_num == 6 or week_num == 8:
            special_tier = "emerald"
        elif week_num == 10 or week_num == 12:
            special_tier = "diamond"
        
        challenge_tasks.append(generate_and_save_tier(
            tier=special_tier,
            week_number=week_num,
            ...
        ))
```

### 3. **Challenge Generation Added to Batch Upload**
**Problem**: Batch upload only created slides and topics, NO challenges  
**Root Cause**: Original code had only Phase 1 (upload) and Phase 2 (topics), no Phase 3 (challenges)  
**Solution**: Added Phase 3 that:
1. Gets lecturer_id from current_user
2. Loops through all extractions
3. Generates base challenge for each week
4. Generates special challenge for even weeks
5. Links challenges with semester_id, module_code, week_number

**Location**: `app/features/slides/endpoints.py` after line ~516

---

### 4. **Test Case Persistence - Already Working!**
**Investigation Result**: The test persistence logic is COMPREHENSIVE and has multiple fallbacks:
1. Tries `question_tests` table with `expected_output` column
2. Falls back to `expected` column if first fails
3. Falls back to legacy `tests` table if both fail
4. Retries up to 2 times per test case

**Test Validation**: Each question gets minimum 3 test cases:
- First test: visibility = "public"
- Remaining tests: visibility = "private"
- Tests normalized from model output

**Location**: `app/features/challenges/challenge_pack_generator.py` lines 1020-1130

**Potential Issue**: If tests aren't showing up, it might be:
- Model not generating tests properly (check raw model output)
- Database schema mismatch (check if `question_tests` table has `expected` or `expected_output`)
- Tests ARE persisted but not queried correctly

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### 1. Prepare 12 Test Files
Create or use existing: `Week1_Variables.pptx` through `Week12_Review.pptx`

### 2. Run Batch Upload
```bash
POST /api/slides/batch-upload
Query params:
  - module_code=COMP101
  - assign_weeks_by_order=true
  - (admin/lecturer auth token)
Files: Upload all 12 files
```

### 3. Verify Results

**Check Slide Extractions**:
```sql
SELECT id, week_number, module_code, detected_topic 
FROM slide_extractions 
WHERE module_code = 'COMP101'
ORDER BY week_number;
-- Expected: 12 rows, weeks 1-12
```

**Check Topics**:
```sql
SELECT id, week, title, slide_extraction_id, module_code 
FROM topics 
WHERE module_code_slidesdeck = 'COMP101'
ORDER BY week;
-- Expected: 12 rows, weeks 1-12
```

**Check Challenges**:
```sql
SELECT id, week_number, challenge_type, tier, module_code 
FROM challenges 
WHERE module_code = 'COMP101'
ORDER BY week_number, challenge_type;
-- Expected: 18 rows
-- Weeks 1,3,5,7,9,11: 1 challenge each (weekly/base)
-- Weeks 2,4,6,8,10,12: 2 challenges each (weekly/base + special/tier)
```

**Check Questions**:
```sql
SELECT q.id, q.challenge_id, q.title, q.tier, COUNT(qt.id) as test_count
FROM questions q
LEFT JOIN question_tests qt ON qt.question_id = q.id
WHERE q.challenge_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM challenges WHERE module_code = 'COMP101'
)
GROUP BY q.id, q.challenge_id, q.title, q.tier
ORDER BY q.challenge_id, q.question_number;
-- Expected: Each question has at least 3 tests
-- Base challenges: 5 questions each (Bronze, Bronze, Silver, Silver, Gold)
-- Special challenges: 1 question each (Ruby/Emerald/Diamond)
```

**Count Tests**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM question_tests 
WHERE question_id IN (
    SELECT q.id 
    FROM questions q 
    JOIN challenges c ON c.id = q.challenge_id 
    WHERE c.module_code = 'COMP101'
);
-- Expected: Minimum 3 tests per question
-- Base: 12 challenges √ó 5 questions √ó 3 tests = 180 tests
-- Special: 6 challenges √ó 1 question √ó 3 tests = 18 tests
-- TOTAL: At least 198 tests
```

## üêõ DEBUGGING TIPS

### If Week Numbers Still Wrong:
1. Check server logs for "week_number" in upload response
2. Verify `assign_weeks_by_order=true` in request
3. Check database: `SELECT week_number FROM slide_extractions ORDER BY created_at`

### If Special Challenges Missing:
1. Check server logs for "Generated X challenges, Y failed"
2. Verify lecturer_id is available in current_user
3. Check if even week detection is working: `week_num % 2 == 0`
4. Check challenges table for `challenge_type='special'`

### If Test Cases Missing:
1. Enable debug mode: Set env var `GENERATOR_DEBUG=1`
2. Check logs for "Primary insert failed" or "Tertiary insert failed"
3. Query actual table schema:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'question_tests';
   ```
4. Check if column is `expected` or `expected_output`
5. Query tests directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM question_tests WHERE question_id = <some_question_id>;
   ```
